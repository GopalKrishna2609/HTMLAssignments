    <section id="Spinach">
        <h1> Spinach</h1>
        <p>This leafy green tops the chart as one of the most nutrient-dense vegetables.
        That’s because 1 cup (30 grams) of raw spinach provides 16% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin A plus 120% of the DV for vitamin K — all for just 7 calories (1Trusted Source).
        Spinach also boasts antioxidants, which may help reduce your risk of disease. One study found that dark leafy greens like spinach are high in beta carotene and lutein, two antioxidants that are associated with a decreased risk of cancer (2Trusted Source).
        Another study suggested that spinach may benefit heart health by helping reduce blood pressure (3Trusted Source).</p>

    <section id="Carrots">
    <h1> Carrots</h1>
    <p>Carrots are packed with vitamin A, delivering 119% of the DV in just 1 cup (128 grams) (4Trusted Source).

    They also contain beta carotene, an antioxidant that provides their vibrant orange color and may help prevent cancer. Your body converts this compound into vitamin A (5Trusted Source).

    In fact, one study in more than 57,000 people associated eating at least 2–4 carrots per week with a 17% lower risk of colorectal cancer in the long run (6Trusted Source).

    A review of 18 studies found that carrots may also reduce lung cancer risk (7Trusted Source).

    Finally, these popular root veggies are high in many other key nutrients, including potassium and vitamins C and K (4Trusted Source).</p>

    <section id="Broccoli">
    <h1> Broccoli</h1>
    <p>Broccoli is rich in a sulfur-containing plant compound called glucosinolate, as well as its byproduct sulforaphane (8).

    Researchers in animal and test-tube studies have extensively explored sulforaphane’s ability to protect against cancer (9Trusted Source).

    This cruciferous veggie may help prevent other types of chronic disease as well.

    One small study found that broccoli sprouts decreased levels of several markers of inflammation, which have been linked to chronic conditions such as heart disease (10Trusted Source).

    Just 1 cup (91 grams) of raw broccoli provides 77% of the DV for vitamin K, 90% of the DV for vitamin C, and a good amount of folate, manganese, and potassium (11Trusted Source).</p>

    <section id="Garlic">
    <h1> Garlic</h1>
    <p>Garlic has been used as a medicinal plant for millennia (12Trusted Source).

    Its main active compound is allicin, which has been shown to aid blood sugar and heart health (13Trusted Source).

    In a 3-month study in 90 people, those who took 1,600 mg of garlic powder per day had significant reductions in belly fat and decreases in blood pressure and triglyceride levels compared with the placebo group (14Trusted Source).

    Garlic powder supplementation also led to improvements in insulin resistance, a condition that may contribute to type 2 diabetes (14Trusted Source).

    Another review of 33 studies found that garlic lowered cholesterol levels and improved blood sugar control, which may support those with heart disease or type 2 diabetes (15Trusted Source).

    Plus, although further research is needed, test-tube and animal studies suggest that allicin has powerful cancer-fighting properties (16Trusted Source).</p>
